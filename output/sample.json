I haven&rsquo;t checked all the files, so if the comments aren&rsquo;t showing up, for example, please let me know.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAs you and your partner go through the feedback you&rsquo;ve received,&nbsp;you will need to exercise discernment. Your peer reviewers may have differing opinions. You may realize that something was unclear, and that your reviewer gave you a suggestion that goes in a different direction than you envisioned&mdash;you might consider their suggestion, but then decide to clarify and strengthen your original idea instead. Your peer reviewers may be quite stringent in their critique, or they may be overly gentle and enthusiastic. This is the nature of peer-review. Above all, it&rsquo;s meant to give you food for thought and to prompt further discussion between you and your partner as you revise and finalize your scripts.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nYou and your partner should also tell each other about the scripts you reviewed. Are there any elements that you would like to incorporate into your own episodes? (I&rsquo;m not, of course, talking about plagiarizing&mdash;your projects are too different for that anyway. I&rsquo;m talking about things like the use of music in transitions, a particularly engaging intro, an expanded conclusion that ties things together really nicely, a fun anecdote, etc.) Did reviewing the work of others give you ideas for revising your own work?&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nI&rsquo;m aiming to send you a few pieces of very basic feedback on your scripts by tomorrow. I won&rsquo;t go into detail due to both time constraints and the fact that you have more extensive feedback from your peers to work with.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSpeaking of time, I still owe some of you grades on your raw interviews. I&rsquo;m going to prioritize brief feedback on your scripts though, because I think that will be most immediately helpful.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLooking forward to seeing you in class,&nbsp;\r\nProfessor Ellis\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;",
